; This file contains all characters or character sequences that
; will be be replaced by SQLTeX when the occur in the response
; of an SQL query.
; It is mainly used for escaping the (La)TeX special characters,
; but any value can be added here.
; The first column is the character (sequence) that will be replaced.
; The second column is the value to replace col 1 with.
; Columns are separated with one or more tab characters.
;
; Note all values are case sensitive; if you add the line:
;   LaTeX	\LaTeX\ 
; the word "latex" will be untouched, but "LaTeX" will be replaced.
;
; To replace using regular expressions, use 're(<regular expression>)' as key (or any other
; regexp indicator if that has been changed in the config file), e.g.
;   re(<p\.*?>)		\paragraph*{}
; will replace all HTML <p> variants (<p style='font-size: normal'>, <p align='center'> etc)
